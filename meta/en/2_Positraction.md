# Positraction - Directed Tension

Let’s take **Meta** as an example.  
They build products for an extremely broad and diverse market - across cultures, ages, values, and lifestyles.

So how do they find balance without descending into chaos?

I suspect that one of the key principles here is **positraction**.

> **Positraction** is not just diversity.  
> It is directed tension between different approaches that work toward a single goal.

## Who Builds the Product?

Products are built by teams.  
Which means the quality of a product directly depends on **how the team is composed**.

Let’s look at two approaches.

## Option 1 - Comfortable Homogeneity

Hiring people similar to you and other team members so it's easy to interact.  
Similar views, experience, and thinking patterns.

**Pros**

- smooth collaboration
- minimal conflict
- high initial speed

**Cons**

- similar mental patterns
- blind spots go unnoticed
- the product reflects a narrow slice of reality

> This approach can work well locally, but it scales poorly for complex and diverse markets.

## Option 2 - Positraction

Hiring people with different backgrounds.  
Culture, age, experience, perspectives - **but with a shared goal**.

**Pros**

- diverse viewpoints
- broader perception of reality
- higher chances of meeting the needs of different segments

**Cons**

- more friction
- more disagreements
- higher demands on communication and team maturity

> This is where **positraction** emerges: differences don’t tear the system apart - they create tension that moves it forward.

## Example

I want to work at **Tesla**.

What does that require?

- a high technical level
- strong meta-skills
- public presence to be noticed

It’s easy to fall into an extreme here.  
For example, focusing only on technical skills - because it’s familiar, safe, and already understood.  
This is a cognitive trap: our brain pulls us toward what we’re already good at and away from uncertainty.

But the problem itself contains the solution.

To get closer to the goal, it’s not enough to be **only** a strong engineer or **only** a public-facing person. You need to hold both sides - even if one of them feels harder.

> In this case, positraction is not a choice between engineering and visibility, but their simultaneous movement in the same direction.

## Conclusion

Positraction is not about compromise or averaging things out.  
It’s about a conscious balance of differences aimed at a single goal.  
The greatest progress doesn’t come from smoothness, but from **the right kind of tension**.
