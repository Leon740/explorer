# Find Your Space

Small children playing soccer often run after the ball in a tight swarm. Everyone wants to be at the center of the action.  
The coach shouts: _“Find your position. Find the space.”_

We often do the same thing.  
We rush into “hot” fields, niches, and projects. It feels like that’s where everything is happening, where all the excitement is.  
But in those places you have to compete with a huge number of people, and making a truly meaningful contribution becomes much harder.

## The Problem

In this situation:

- competition increases
- the value of an individual decreases
- effort doesn't produce significant return

You can be smart, hardworking, and capable, but if you’re the twelfth player on a team of eleven, you’re not needed.

Of course, there are cases where someone has significantly greater experience and knowledge.  
Such a person can win the competition and make a meaningful impact.  
But that’s more an exception than a reliable strategy.

## The Solution

Finding your space is **not** about:

- becoming a loner
- searching for exotic niches just for the sake of it
- going against the market out of principle

It’s about finding an area where your effort produces a significant return.

## How

### 0\ Observe Yourself

- what genuinely interests me and gives me energy
- where and when I can stay focused for long periods
- which processes I enjoy for their own sake, not just for the outcome

Examples of questions to ask yourself:

- do I enjoy communicating with people all day?
- can I spend hours reading documentation, understanding concepts, writing code?

### 1\ Niches

A niche with proven competition versus an unexplored one.

The choice depends on your current situation: your financial state, obligations, and the level of risk you can afford.

The most sustainable option is a **hybrid**.  
Fully switching to a new niche and failing can cost you your position and set you back for a long time.  
A much wiser approach is to keep working in a proven area while gradually investing small bets into something new.

## Example

I like technology, design, and coding, the process itself. I earn money as a web developer and started doing it long before it became mainstream.

### A Stable Asset

Okay, I have a “stable asset” that brings me dividends. How do I grow it? - By developing meta-skills:

- not another framework, but the ability to learn, understand core concepts, and invest time in “old” but fundamental technical books
- understanding the domain: the company’s product, its goals and values (even if they’re not explicitly stated, they still exist, and act aligning with them or based on them)
- clear communication: accepting feedback, articulating ideas, negotiating, and making estimates

### A Risky Asset

- pet projects  
  An idea appears, I want to explore a new technology, or I notice a problem worth trying to solve.

- conferences and networking  
  The butterfly effect: one short conversation can lead to new opportunities, teams, or directions.

**The essence:** fixed costs (time and energy) - potentially disproportionate results.
